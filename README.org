* EAZY-Project - Interactive Project Generator & Manager

This is basically a fork from cl-project@fukamachi, but I'm gonna go much further...

Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(eazy-project:create)
#+END_SRC

* Basic features

The main contributions in cl-project@fukamachi compared to the other
project-generation libraries were:

+ Templating based on CL-EMB 
+ Unit testing as default

Additional changes includes:

+ interactive project generation
+ interactive dependency management
+ unit-testing library can be customizable
+ automatic initialization with a version control system (currently git)

To load this library, clone the repo into the quicklisp's local-project
directory and run
=(ql:register-local-project)(ql:quickload :eazy-project)=.
