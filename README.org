* EAZY-Project - Interactive Project Generator & Manager

This is basically a fork from cl-project@fukamachi.
I use it for myself.

Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(ql:quickload :eazy-project)
;; no command is required, all you need is to load the library

;; or, if the library is loaded in the image, try
(eazy-project:launch-menu)

;; or its synonim :
eazy-project:!
#+END_SRC

And follow the instruction that appears in the debugger.

To load this library, clone the repo into the quicklisp's local-project
directory and run
=(ql:register-local-project)(ql:quickload :eazy-project)=.
